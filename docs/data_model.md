# Personal Research Conceptual Data Model

This document defines conceptual entities and relationships for later reviewed persistence work. It is not a database schema, migration plan, ORM model, or API contract.

## Research And Market Context

- **Market snapshot:** timestamped local view of indices, breadth, style, liquidity, sector rotation, crowding, and market risk.
- **Research case:** versioned work container with mode, scope, cutoff date, separate lifecycle and conclusion statuses, conclusions, and linked revisions.
- **Research scope:** market, industry, company universe, geography, horizon, and exclusion context for a research case.
- **Industry driver, chain node, bottleneck, and value-pool shift:** linked industry-map concepts that explain a proposed causal path.
- **Company beneficiary relationship:** a company's proposed relationship to a chain node, driver, product, customer, or bottleneck, including its financial transmission assumptions.

## Evidence And Research Judgment

- **Evidence:** dated source artifact with provenance and grade: A for official or primary evidence, B for reliable industry evidence, C for auxiliary media or research evidence, and D for leads or rumors. D-grade evidence cannot independently support a conclusion.
- **Claim:** a factual statement or explicitly labeled `推断` belonging to a research case. Every material claim records source, source date, information cutoff date, evidence grade, summary, inference flag, inference basis, confidence, conflicts, and pending verification. Missing support is recorded as `尚未获得可靠公开证据`.
- **Claim-evidence link:** the relationship that states whether evidence supports, contradicts, or contextualizes a claim.
- **Conflict:** a reviewed disagreement between evidence items or claims, with an explicit resolution state.
- **Screen, expectation, valuation snapshot, catalyst, and risk:** dated assessment artifacts linked to a research case or company relationship.
- **Case lifecycle status:** versioned workflow progress using `draft`, `evidence-gathering`, `under-review`, `watching`, `verified`, `invalidated`, or `archived`.
- **Research conclusion status:** a separate versioned conclusion using one of eight canonical values: `核心研究候选`, `估值合理，可持续跟踪`, `公司优秀但价格偏贵`, `等待业绩验证`, `认证期高赔率观察`, `周期拐点观察`, `产业相关但受益纯度低`, or `逻辑证伪或排除`.
- **Verification task:** the task used to confirm, weaken, contradict, or leave unresolved a linked claim or thesis. Pending tasks form the mandatory `后续验证清单` at the end of each completed research output.
- **Stage 1 beneficiary classification:** identifies a company as a direct, secondary, or potential beneficiary. Only companies with one of these Stage 1 classifications can enter a Stage 2 candidate pool.

## Watchlists And History

- **Watchlist:** a personal collection of research cases or companies.
- **Watchlist entry:** current research status, catalysts, risks, verification tasks, and references to source cases.
- **Revision:** immutable historical snapshot of a conclusion, status change, or material thesis update.

## Paper Portfolio

- **Paper portfolio:** a named, simulated portfolio with base currency, benchmark reference, and local-only purpose.
- **Simulated order and simulated trade:** manual paper records only; they have no broker, real-order, or execution meaning.
- **Position, cash ledger, NAV, benchmark, and corporate action:** time-series records used to reconstruct simulated portfolio state and comparison.
- **Thesis snapshot:** an immutable copy of the relevant research conclusion, risks, catalysts, and evidence state associated with a simulated position at a point in time.

## Quant Core Records

Existing Quant Core concepts remain reusable records: normalized provider data, factor values and scores, ranking outputs, backtest results, ML feature/label/prediction artifacts, research reports, and read-only Dashboard payloads. Later product records reference these outputs as versioned validation inputs; Quant Core does not own product workflow state.

## Relationship Summary

```text
Market snapshot -> research case -> claims <-> evidence
Research case -> industry map -> Stage 1 beneficiary classification -> Stage 2 candidate pool
Research case -> screens / valuation snapshots / catalysts / risks / verification tasks
Research case -> watchlist entry -> revision history
Research case -> thesis snapshot -> paper portfolio -> simulated trades / positions / NAV
Quant Core records -> research-case validation inputs
```

The implemented v0.5B boundary stops at the industry map. Stable map, node, relationship, and observation identities have immutable revisions. Every asserted revision references exact v0.5A claim revisions, and each map revision freezes exact assertion revisions. Beneficiary classification and the Stage 2 candidate pool remain unimplemented.
